The game pits two teams against each other: the Terrorists and the Counter-Terrorists. Both sides are tasked with eliminating the other while also completing separate objectives. The Terrorists, depending on the game mode, must either plant the bomb or defend the hostages, while the Counter-Terrorists must either prevent the bomb from being planted, defuse the bomb, or rescue the hostages.",

      "text": "The gameplay in Global Offensive is similar to that of previous games in the Counter-Strike series in the sense that it is an objective-based multiplayer first-person shooter. The Terrorists must either plant the bomb or defend the hostages, while the Counter-Terrorists must either prevent the bomb from being planted, defuse the bomb, or rescue the hostages. At the end of each round, players are rewarded based on their individual performance with in-game currency to spend on more powerful weapons in subsequent rounds. Winning rounds rewards more money than losing does, and completing objectives such as killing enemy players gives cash bonuses. Uncooperative actions, such as killing teammates, will result in a penalty.",

Arms Race is a gun-progression mode featuring instant respawning and is inspired by the “Gun Game” mod for other games in the series. Demolition mode is similar to the “Gun Game” mod, but the players are rewarded for each kill with a more powerful weapon, or grenade. Casual mode is a less intense version of the Competitive mode as players do not have to commit as much time or damage to their opponents.",
